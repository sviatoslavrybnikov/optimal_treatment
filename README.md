# Optimal Treatment Strategy
This repository contains the Octave/MATLAB code used in the study:

**"Integrating gene drives with established pest controls to mitigate spillover risk"**  
by *Sviatoslav R. Rybnikov, Adam Lampert, and Gili Greenbaum*.

---

## Overview
The code identifies the **optimal multi-treatment strategy** involving:
- gene drive deployment  
- pesticide application  
- sterile male release  

The algorithm minimizes the total cost of eradication, including:
- **Direct treatment costs**  
- **Indirect costs due to spillover risk**  

---

## Requirements
- Octave 7.1 or later
- No additional toolboxes are required.
