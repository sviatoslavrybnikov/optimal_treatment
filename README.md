Code for: "Integrating gene drives with established pest controls to mitigate spillover risk" (Rybnikov SR, Lampert A, Greenbaum G)
# Optimal Treatment Strategy

This repository contains the Octave/MATLAB code used in the study:

**"Integrating gene drives with established pest controls to mitigate spillover risk"**  
by *Sviatoslav R. Rybnikov, Adam Lampert, and Gili Greenbaum*.

---

## Overview
The code identifies the **optimal multi-treatment strategy** combining:
- Gene drives  
- Pesticides  
- Sterile males  

The optimization accounts for both:
- **Direct treatment costs**  
- **Indirect costs due to spillover risk**  

---

## Requirements
- Octave 9.2 or later
- No additional toolboxes are required.
